## A overview of different schoolwork
I have gathered here some of the schoolwork I have done during my math studies. The assignments are problem solving assignments that are solved with a numerical approach. This overview is divided into three different assignments.

## The first assignment: Harjoitustyö
* This assignment was part of a course called Convex Analysis and Optimization at University of Turku. During the course we looked at different methods for optimizing functions with and without restrictions. 
* In this assignment I have used three different methods for optimizing three different functions with different restrictions. I have described the problem and method I chose to use. then I used python to solve the problem itself. 
* This assignment is in Finnish. 

## The second assignment: Datorövning 1
* This assignment was part of a course called Numerical Analysis at Åbo Akademi. During the course we looked at different methods for solving problems that one cannot solve analytically hence they must be solved numerically. 
* The assignment was following: “You have two circles that overlap so that half of one of the circles areas is covered by the other. Calculate how far in one of the circles this happen (this point is called alpha).” First, I described how to calculate the problem and then I solved it in MATLAB. 
* There are two files in this folder, one mlx file and one PDF. The PDF file is an exported file of the mlx file for the case if you cannot open the mlx file. 
* The assignment is in Swedish.  

## The third assignment: Datorövning 2
* This assignment was also a part of a course called Numerical Analysis at Åbo Akademi. 
* The assignment was to calculate an integral numerically with trapezoidal rule which is to be Richardson extrapolated. First, I described how to calculate the problem and then I solved it in MATLAB. 
* There are also two files in this folder, one mlx file and one PDF. The PDF file is an exported file of the mlx file for the case if you cannot open the mlx file. 
* This assignment is also in Swedish.
