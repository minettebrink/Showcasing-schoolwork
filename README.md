## A overview of different schoolwork
I have gathered here some of the schoolwork I have done during my math studies. The assignments are problem solving assignments that are solved with a numerical approach. This overview is divided into three different assignments.

## The first assignment: Harjoitustyö
* This assignment was part of a course called Convex Analysis and Optimization at University of Turku. During the course we looked at different methods for optimizing functions with and without restrictions. 
* In this assignment I have used three different methods for optimizing three different functions with different restrictions. I have described the problem and method I chose to use. I used python to program the solutions. 
* This assignment is in Finnish. 

## The second assignment: Datorövning 1
* This assignment was part of a course called Numerical Analysis at Åbo Akademi. During the course we looked at different methods for solving problems that one cannot be solved analytically. 
* The assignment was as follows: “You have two circles that overlap each other such that half of one of the circle's areas is covered by the other, calculate how far in one of the circles this happens (this point is called alpha in the image).” First, I described how to calculate the problem and then I solve it in MATLAB.
* There are two files in this folder, one .mlx file and one .pdf. The .pdf file is an exported file of the .mlx file for the case if you cannot open the .mlx file. 
* The assignment is in Swedish.  

## The third assignment: Datorövning 2
* This assignment was also a part of the course called Numerical Analysis at Åbo Akademi. 
* The assignment was to calculate an integral numerically with trapezoidal rule which should be Richardson extrapolated. First, I describe how to calculate the problem and then  solve it in MATLAB.
* There are also two files in this folder, one .mlx file and one .pdf. 
* This assignment is also in Swedish.
